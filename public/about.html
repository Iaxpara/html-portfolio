<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi my name is Ian Anslow</p>
<p> I currently am working as a field service engineer installing computerised access control systems.
  We have to set up and install all relevant software, which involves interacting, setting up and opening ports with firewalls, 
  virtual servers, windows 10 and 11. I have certification for all relevant aspects of my current job.</p>

<p>I have completed my CIWA and currently doing a Web Development Course. I have built and coded my own
  variometer using an adruino mini dev board, it is still verion 1 but I intend to develop it further.
</p>
<p>My main hobby is paragliding, the freedom and feeling of being alive it instils in me is amazing. 
  I love going on walks in the local woods or along the sea front with my wife and we simply love 
  listening to nature.</p>
